The "aerodynamic_experiments_plotting_script.m" can be placed inside the "IISRD_Aerodynamic_experiments_data" folder from [Zenodo](10.5281/zenodo.4568184) and ran.

The "self_righting_experiments_plotting_script.m" can be placed next to the desired .csv file within the "IISRD_self_righting_experiments_data" folder from [Zenodo](10.5281/zenodo.4568184). Then, the filename must be changed within "self_righting_experiments_plotting_script.m" to match the .csv, and from there the script can be ran.
