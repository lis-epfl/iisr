Insect inspired self-righting for fixed wing drones

In this repository we provide the source code accompanying our article: "Insect inspired self-righting for fixed wing drones".
Specifically, we provide the MATLAB Simulink simulation of our self-righting drone which can be modified to test different types of self-righting configurations. 
Moreover we supply the MATLAB scripts we used for analyzing and visualizing the aerodynamic data we collected with our wind-tunnel configuration. 
Finally the CAD for the drone is provided which can be used to adapt the proposed self-righting mechanism to any conventional UAV and to build it.
## Requirements
For developing and runnning the simulation and the scripts, we used MATLAB R2020a with the Simulink extention in a Windows 10 x64 operating system.

## Usage
The repository has three main components. 
- A folder called `CAD`, which contains the Inventor part (.ipt) and assembly (.iam) files.
- A folder called `scripts`, which contains the dynamic and aerodynamic analysis and visualization scripts.
- A folder called `simulation`, which contains the MATLAB Simulink simulation files.
